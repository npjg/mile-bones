# mile-bones

When I was a little boy, I didn't care much for storybooks. I loved introductory
Windows guide books -- like the Livingstons' _Secrets_ series and the adorable
_Simplified_ series from MaranGraphics. These were my picture books.

I clearly remember my first picture book -- MaranGraphics' [_Windows 95
Simplified_](https://archive.org/details/windows95simplif00fost). I still dream
about the sublime metaphors of [_Teach yourself Word 97
visually_](https://archive.org/details/teachyourselfwor00mara/mode/2up).

More than any other book, however, I loved the Livingston's [_Windows
Gizmos_](https://archive.org/details/windowsgizmos0000livi). This shareware
book fascinated me to no end with its promise of *four* 5.25-inch floppies full
of Windows 3 software. I must have gotten mine from a yard sale, so I had no
disks and certainly to drive to put them in.

And in that book, no program fascinated me more than [_Mile
Bones_](https://archive.org/details/win3_MileBone).

Since then, I've had a bit of an obsession with computer-based
Mille Bornes games, and when I was a bit older I also loved playing
Micaceler [Pocket Bornes](http://www.mobyware.org/acer-n20-device-159/word-games-tag/micaceler-pocket-bornes-download-84689.html) on my HP Jornada 568.
I recently used `wrestool` to extract the bitmaps from that game too.
